For my Final Project, I have create my own RPG engine using SFML and C++, and have created a small game with it.
All thats needed to play it is to drag the sfmltest.exe file from the debug folder into the main sfmltest folder. You should be able to run this file (you may need sfml installed on your computer, im not entirely sure).

The main game file is Source.cpp. This file instantiates and organizes all game mechanics and is where the actual "game" is.

Point of the Game:
Fight Enemies and get stronger.
Try and beat the final boss

Controls:
Movement -> Arrow Keys
Inventory -> I key
Health Potion -> H key
